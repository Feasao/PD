        "Education": "Aaronson grew up in the United States, though he spent a year in Asia when his father—a science writer turned public-relations executive—was posted to Hong Kong.[6] He enrolled in a school there that permitted him to skip ahead several years in math, but upon returning to the US, he found his education restrictive, getting bad grades and having run-ins with teachers. He enrolled in The Clarkson School, a gifted education program run by Clarkson University, which enabled Aaronson to apply for colleges while only in his freshman year of high school.[6] He was accepted into Cornell University, where he obtained his BSc in computer science in 2000,[7] and where he resided at the Telluride House.[8] He then attended the University of California, Berkeley, for his PhD, which he got in 2004 under the supervision of Umesh Vazirani.[9]\n Aaronson had shown ability in mathematics from an early age, teaching himself calculus at the age of 11, provoked by symbols in a babysitter's textbook. He discovered computer programming at age 11, and felt he lagged behind peers, who had already been coding for years. In part due to Aaronson getting into advanced mathematics before getting into computer programming, he felt drawn to theoretical computing, particularly computational complexity theory. At Cornell, he became interested in quantum computing and devoted himself to computational complexity and quantum computing.[6]",

He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,[30][31] and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982.[30] In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention \"to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park\".[32]\n After graduating from high school in 1982, Bezos attended Princeton University. He initially majored in physics but later switched to electrical engineering and computer science.[33] Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[34] In addition, he was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).[35][36] He had a 4.2 GPA and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi.

For related reasons, his mother had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country.[7]\n The Brin family lived in Vienna and Paris while Mikhail Brin secured a teaching position at the University of Maryland with help from Anatole Katok. During this time, the Brin family received support and assistance from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. They arrived in the United States on October 25, 1979.[7][9]\n Brin attended elementary school at Paint Branch Montessori School in Adelphi, Maryland, but he received further education at home; his father, a professor in the department of mathematics at the University of Maryland, encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills. He attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Maryland. In September 1990, Brin enrolled in the University of Maryland, where he received his Bachelor of Science from the Department of Computer Science in 1993 with honors in computer science and mathematics at the age of 19.[10] In 1993, he interned at Wolfram Research, the developers of Mathematica.[10]\n Brin began his graduate study in computer science at Stanford University on a graduate fellowship from the National Science Foundation, receiving an M.S. in computer science in 1995.[11] As of 2008[update], he was on leave from his PhD studies at Stanford.[12]",

Before the civil rights movement, education for black communities was extremely limited. Segregation was prevalent everywhere in society and black children were not offered the same opportunities as white children. Inspired by her mother to follow her dreams, set goals and work hard at them, Easley dedicated herself to her studies. She graduated valedictorian of Holy Family High School and enrolled in Xavier University in New Orleans. Four years later she got married and moved to Cleveland where she would continue to puruse a career in pharmaceuticals which would prove improbable. The next year, she divorced and moved back to Birmingham to be near her family. Being recently divorced and out of work after recently moving back home, Annie was constanlty on the search for work. However, Jim Crow laws were still in place during this time and black people were required to take literacy tests and pay poll taxes. Easley would help many members of her community to pass these tests and receive ultimately find jobs.\n Before the Civil Rights Movement, educational and career opportunities for African-American children were very limited. Segregation was prevalent, African-American children were educated separately from white children, and their schools were often inferior to white schools. Annie's mother told her that she could be anything, but she would have to work at it. She encouraged Annie to get a good education. From the fifth grade through high school, Annie attended Holy Family High School, and was valedictorian of her graduating class.[3] At a young age Annie had interest in becoming a nurse, but around the age of 16 she decided to study pharmacy.[2]\n In 1950, Easley enrolled in classes at Xavier University in New Orleans,[4] an African-American Catholic university, and majored in pharmacy for about two years.[3]\n In 1977, she obtained a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Cleveland State University.[5][6]",

While at Oregon State, he was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon social fraternity.[10][11] He was hired by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at the Ames Research Center, where he worked in wind tunnel maintenance. In his off hours he enjoyed hiking, camping, and folk dancing.

They were married in Portola State Park on May 5, 1951. Soon after, Engelbart left Ames to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

His mother was a concert pianist, although she did not perform professionally. She died from cancer when he was 11. His father was a businessperson but had lost everything in the 1929 stock market crash and as a result, the family was relatively poor. At times he lived with other families or with his older sister. Eventually, his father remarried, and he and his sister moved back in. As a child, he was both entrepreneurial and interested in science and how things work. He did various weekend and after-school things to earn money, eventually handling a large newspaper delivery route. At age 10 he bought chemistry supplies and made his own fireworks, which were then illegal in Los Angeles. He did poorly in school because he didn't do homework. He graduated from John Marshall High School a semester early so that he could earn money for Caltech tuition and living expenses. Caltech later told him he had been admitted with the worst high school grades they had ever seen. He quit Caltech partway through his sophomore year.[4]\n He then joined the United States Air Force (USAF) to become a fighter pilot. His computer career started in 1956 when the Air Force assigned him to MIT Lincoln Laboratory where he worked on the SAGE computer.[5]",

        "Education": "William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington[13]as the only son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (1925–2020) and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).[14] His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.[15] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. He also has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" (i.e., three) because his father had the \"II\" suffix.[16][17] The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.[18]\n According to Gates, when he was young, his parents wanted him to pursue a career in law.[19] During his childhood, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[20][21][22] Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child.[17] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".[23]\n At age 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school,[24][25] where he wrote his first software program.[26] When he was in eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students.[27] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.[28] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[29][17]\n The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.[17] At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using the system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business.\n The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of his life. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside.[17]\n At 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[30] In 1972, he served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives.[31][32] He was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[33] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[34][35] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics (including Math 55) and graduate level computer science courses.[36] While at Harvard, he met fellow student and future Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO and maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.[37][38]\n Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[39] presented in a combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis. His solution held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years, and its successor is faster by only 2%.[39][40] His solution was formalized and published in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[41]\n Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[42] In 1975, the MITS Altair 8800 was released based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[43] Gates dropped out of Harvard that same year. His parents were supportive of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company.[44] He explained his decision to leave Harvard: \"if things hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on leave.\"[45]",

At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).[9] Later in life, she was known for keeping a clock that ran backward, she explained, \"Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.\"[10] For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Grace was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (because her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.\n In 1930, Grace Murray married New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–1976); they divorced in 1945.[11][12] She did not marry again and retained his surname.\n In 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale[13] under the direction of Øystein Ore.[11][14] Her dissertation, \"New Types of Irreducibility Criteria\",[15] was published that same year.[16] She began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.[17]",

        "Education": "Hui was born in Hong Kong in 1953. In 1966, he immigrated to Canada with his entire family.[3]\n In 1973, Hui entered the University of Alberta. In his second year he took a course on probability and statistics in which students were expected to learn the programming language APL with little or no formal instruction. He used all the time he could muster on a heavily burdened computer, and benefited from the APL\\360 User's Manual (the book APL Language was not published until March 1975). Because the manual was written by Adin Falkoff and Kenneth E. Iverson, Hui thought it reasonable to say he learned APL from Falkoff and Iverson.\n As a summer student in 1975 and 1976, Hui worked at I. P. Sharp Associates (IPSA) in Calgary, on workspaces for statistical and probability calculations. The major attraction of the job was the unrestricted computer time with access to APL.\n After receiving a BSc degree with first class honors in computer science in 1977, Hui worked for two years as a full-time programmer and analyst in the new Edmonton office of IPSA, where his main duty was to support clients in their use of APL time-sharing. He attended the APL79 conference in Rochester, New York, where Iverson gave two papers: \"The Role of Operators in APL\" and \"The Derivative Operator\". On the way, Hui stopped at IPSA in Toronto and obtained a copy of \"Operators and Functions\" [IBM Research Report No. 7091, 1978]. He has been studying that paper and its successors ever since.[citation needed]\n In September 1979, Hui entered the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, and received his MSc in May 1981 with a thesis on \"The complexity of some decompositions in matrix algebra.\"[4]\n After completing his master's degree, Hui worked from 1981 to 1985 as an APL systems analyst and programmer for the Alberta Energy Company in Edmonton. In February 1982 Hui purchased A Source Book in APL (1981), in which the most memorable papers were \"The Design of APL\" (1973), \"The Evolution of APL\" (1978), and \"Notation as a Tool of Thought\" (1980).\n Hui's work was described at the APL85 conference in a paper, \"DESIGN: A Financial Modelling System\", written jointly with his supervisor, Fred Appleyard. The basic objects in the system were in \"Direct Definition\" (Iverson, 1976, 1980), and Falkoff and Iverson's The Design of APL was cited. Hui left Alberta Energy shortly after being promoted to a non-APL and non-programming position, and was out of work, and had no access to computers, from September 1985 to April 1986. This gave him plenty of time for intense study of Iverson's Rationalized APL (1983) and A Dictionary of the APL Language, as it was then named.\n Hui and his wife Stella had two children.  He died on October 16, 2021, from cancer.[5]",

At age 17, while still out of school, he enrolled in a correspondence course on radios with De Forest Training in Chicago, and learned calculus by self-study from a textbook.[4][6]\nDuring World War II, while serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force, he took correspondence courses toward a high school diploma.\n After the war, Iverson enrolled in Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, taking advantage of government support for ex-servicemen and under threat from an Air Force buddy who said he would \"beat his brains out if he did not grasp the opportunity\".[4] He graduated in 1950 as the top student with a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics.[3]\n Continuing his education at Harvard University, he began in the Department of Mathematics and received a Master's degree in 1951.  He then switched to the Department of Engineering and Applied Physics, working with Howard Aiken and Wassily Leontief.\n Kenneth Iverson has recalled graduate study under Aiken as \"like an apprenticeship\" in which the student \"learned the tools of the scholarship trade\". Every topic was \"used more as a focus for the development of skills such as clarity of thought and expression than as an end in itself\". Once admitted to the program, a graduate student underwent a rite of \"adoption into the fold\". He was given a desk (or a share of a desk) among a group of other graduate students, the permanent staff, or visiting scholars, \"most of whom were engaged in some aspect of the design and building of computers\". A student was thus \"made to feel part of a scholarly enterprise\" and was provided, \"often for the first time, with easy and intimate access to others more experienced in his chosen field\". When interviewing Aiken, I had asked him whether Tropp and I might see his lecture notes; Aiken replied that he had always destroyed his lecture notes at the end of each year, so that he would not be tempted to repeat his lectures. Howard Aiken had developed the Harvard Mark I, one of the first large-scale digital computers, while Wassily Leontief was an economist who was developing the input–output model of economic analysis, work for which he would later receive the Nobel prize. Leontief's model required large matrices and Iverson worked on programs that could evaluate these matrices on the Harvard Mark IV computer. Iverson received a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1954 with a dissertation based on this work.[9][10]\n At Harvard, Iverson met Eoin Whitney, a 2-time Putnam Fellow and fellow graduate student from Alberta.[11][12]  This had future ramifications.",

He graduated with bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Physics, and a master's degree in Applied Mathematics, all in 1972.[14]\n For his senior thesis, advised in part by Dennis Gabor, was to bounce acoustic waves in the 40 mHz range off real-world objects, record their interference patterns on a 2-meter square plot, photo-reduce those to a 10-mm square film image, shine a laser through the film, and thus project the three-dimensional imaged object—i.e., the first known acoustic hologram.[citation needed] To settle an argument with Dr. Gabor, Lenat computer-generated a five-dimensional hologram, by photo-reducing computer printout of the interference pattern of a globe rotating and expanding over time, reducing the large two-dimensional paper printout to a moderately large 5-cm square film surface through which a conventional laser beam was then able to project a three-dimensional image, which changed in two independent ways (rotating and changing in size) as the film was moved up-down or left-right.[citation needed]\n Lenat was a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University, where his published research included automatic program synthesis from input/output pairs and from natural language clarification dialogues.[15]",

At Berkeley, she had only one other female classmate in her major.[6] She applied to graduate mathematics programs at Berkeley and Princeton. At the time Princeton was not accepting female students in mathematics.[7] She was accepted at Berkeley but instead moved to Boston and began working at Mitre Corporation, where she became interested in computers and programming. She worked at Mitre for one year before taking a programming job at Harvard working on language translation.[7]\n She then decided to go back to school and applied again to Berkeley, but also to Stanford and Harvard. In March 1968 she became one of the first women in the United States to be awarded a Ph.D. from a computer science department when she was awarded her degree from Stanford University.[8][9][10] At Stanford, she worked with John McCarthy and was supported to work in artificial intelligence.[7] The topic of her Ph.D. thesis was a computer program to play chess endgames for which she developed the important killer heuristic.[11]",

        "Education": "From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,[23] and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life.[39] Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King,[a] and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her \"much help in her mathematical studies\" including study of advanced calculus topics including the \"numbers of Bernoulli\" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine).[40] In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".[41]\n Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science. Whilst studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan:\n I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar.[42] Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring \"the unseen worlds around us\".[43]",

The family was obliged to relocate frequently during the Great Depression, until McCarthy's father found work as an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in Los Angeles, California. His father came from Cromane, a small fishing village in County Kerry, Ireland.[5] His mother died in 1957.[6]\n Both parents were active members of the Communist Party during the 1930s, and they encouraged learning and critical thinking. Before he attended high school, he got interested in science by reading a translation of a Russian popular science book for children, called 100,000 Whys.[7]  John was fluent in the Russian language and made friends with Russian scientists during multiple trips to the Soviet Union but he distanced himself after making visits to the Soviet Bloc, which led to him becoming a conservative Republican.[8]\n McCarthy graduated from Belmont High School two years early.[9] McCarthy was accepted into Caltech in 1944.\n McCarthy showed an early aptitude for mathematics; during his teens he taught himself college mathematics by studying the textbooks used at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech). As a result, he was able to skip the first two years of mathematics at Caltech.[10]\nMcCarthy was suspended from Caltech for failure to attend physical education courses.[11] He then served in the US Army and was readmitted, receiving a BS in mathematics in 1948.[12]\n It was at Caltech that he attended a lecture by John von Neumann that inspired his future endeavors.\n McCarthy initially completed graduate studies at Caltech before moving to Princeton University. He received a PhD in mathematics from Princeton in 1951 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"Projection operators and partial differential equations\", under the supervision of Donald C. Spencer.[13]",

The indexing of image, sound, navigation, and especially the possibility to produce an individualized record (through an integrated Notebook application) were unique at the time\n Based on the fact that play is serious work for the very young, Nadin initiated a program in Toy Design at SUNY - Fashion Institute of Technology to train designers to develop the minds of the very young through all the senses. He also insisted on integrating the (then) new digital technology into toys for pre-school and school-age children so that they could experience the possibilities of digital technology beyond mere computer games.",

        "Education": "SK Pal studied at the University of Calcutta for his BSc in physics (1969), and BTech (1972) and MTech (1974) in radio physics and electronics. \nHe received a PhD in radio physics and electronics from the Rajabazar Science College campus of University of Calcutta in 1979 as a student of Indian Statistical Institute, and another PhD in electrical engineering along with Diploma of the Imperial College from Imperial College, University of London, in 1982. After completing PhD at Imperial College, London as a Commonwealth Scholar, he did post-doctoral research there during 1982 to 1983 as a UK Medical Research Council Fellow. Subsequently, he worked at the University of California, Berkeley and University of Maryland, College Park from 1986 to 1987 as a Fulbright Fellow; NASA Johnson Space Center from 1990 to 1992 and in 1994 as a US NAS-NRC Senior Research Associate; and US Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. in 2004 as a visiting scientist. Besides, he had been a Distinguished Visitor of IEEE Computer Society (USA) for Asia-Pacific Region since 1997, and held several visiting positions in Australia, Poland, Italy, France, New Zealand, Japan and Hong Kong universities. He established sustained research collaborations in Europe through various European universities including the Warsaw University, Poland (1997-2017); Naples University, Italy (2004-2020) and INSEAD, France (2001-2013), under joint agreements between Nations or Institutes.\n Pal joined the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, as a CSIR Senior Research Fellow in 1975, and eventually entered into full professor position in 1987. He then became a distinguished scientist in 1998, the director in 2005, and the president in 2022. He was the first computer scientist as well as someone outside statistics and mathematics to become the director of ISI in its 75-year history. He is also the first ex-employee of ISI being elected to hold the honorable chair of President of ISI since its inception in 1931.[4][5]\n His areas of research interests include fuzzy sets and uncertainty analysis, artificial neural networks for machine intelligence, pattern recognition, image processing, data mining, granular computing, genetic algorithms, rough sets, and soft computing with applications such as in bioinformatics, video analytics, online social network analysis, and cognitive mind development. He has pioneered hybrid intelligent systems like neuro fuzzy and rough fuzzy hybridization. The generic families of such hybrid intelligent models (networks) developed not only provide enhanced learning, understandability, knowledge mining and uncertainty management in decision-making, but also can explain the network decision in natural language. Besides, rough-fuzzy hybridization enables mining linguistic, categorical, and relational data. All these have led to significant synergistic technological developments in modern AI and data science. His image processing research in 1970s is perhaps the first investigation (other pioneer being A. Rosenfeld, UMD, College Park, USA) that brings out the root relation between the abstract concept of fuzzy sets and image processing tasks & the associated uncertainty involved. Subsequently, definitions for image entropy (mid 1980s) and generalized rough-fuzzy entropy (mid 2000s) based on logarithmic and exponential gain functions are provided for modelling the uncertainty. These measures are unique. Prof. Pal is widely recognized across the world for his pioneering and extraordinary contributions in Machine Intelligence, Fuzzy Logic, Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition. This has made India a leader in these disciplines in international scenario. His other highly cited original/ fundamental research include: i) Unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm (in early 2000s) producing maximally independent features, that results in fast and superior performance and is suitable for Big data, ii) Granular computing concept and models particularly when samples are indiscernible; here computations are performed using information granules rather than individual samples, thereby providing gain in both computation and performance in mining tasks, and iii) Z*-number, developed in mid 2010s, for machine subjectivity representation in machine-mind development by encapsulating the objective and subjective time, context, and affect components in natural language of thoughts, speech, and texts. \n He is a co-author of twenty one books, eighteen conference proceedings, about five hundred and fifty research publications, and two US patents. He has served/serving as editor in most of the well-known scientific journals in computer science and engineering (~25 international journals).[1] He visited more than forty countries as a Keynote/ Invited speaker or academic visitor. He has co-authored with researchers from 48 foreign and 16 Indian institutes.\n According to Google Scholar, Pal's work had been cited about 37,000 times with h-index of 84.\n SK Pal is the scientist who introduced the Soft Computing concept and research in India.\n For his outstanding contributions, the Department of Science and Technology, GoI, established under his leadership the Center for Soft Computing Research (CSCR), first in Asia, in 2004 at ISI, Kolkata. Subsequently, CSCR is declared by the Governing Body of ISI as an Associate Institute of ISI in 2010. Apart from acting as a strong base for nationwide research and training with linkage to industries and premier institutes in India and abroad, CSCR had special provision for funding and mentoring less endowed institutions, including those in North-East regions of India. \n Machine Intelligence Unit (MIU) founded by him in 1993 at ISI, Kolkata has now turned out to be an internationally recognized leading research school producing many science leaders. These demonstrate his visionary leadership.\n It is during Pal's directorship of ISI (2005-2010), when the birthday of Prof. P.C. Mahalanobis, the founder of ISI, was declared by the Prime Minister of India on 24 Dec 2006, as the “National Statistics Day” to be celebrated every year over the country. Further, establishing the ISI-Chennai Center, approving the ISI-North Eastern Center, and replacing UGC-pay scales by higher IISc-pay scales for faculty at ISI, are some other major achievements under his visionary leadership as Director of ISI.\n Biennial International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (PReMI), started in 2005, is his another brainchild. This facilitates regular interaction among Indian researchers with international experts in AI, ML and related areas for advancing science & technology.\n All these activities, including foundation of MIU & CSCR and visionary leadership as ISI-Director, have long lasting educational and societal impact.\n SK Pal has graduated officially 22 PhD students, so far, in India and abroad. It is not the number, but the quality which was his only concern. Many of his PhDs are now internationally known leading scientists with recognitions like Fellows of IEEE, TWAS, IFSA, INSA, INAE, J.C. Bose National Fellow, Padma Shri, S.S. Bhatnagar awardee, P.C. Mahalanobis National Award of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI), Govt. of India, Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transaction, Vice-President of Multinational IT Company, and Directors of premier national Institutes.\n Donations to Alma-maters and Instituting Medals/Fellowships to benefit the science & society: Besides his academic and research contributions, Pal has instituted the following awards in his alma-maters, starting from school education. These are aimed at nurturing the talent and scientific spirit as well as to help the students from less priviledged community, which in turn benefits the society: i) Two Merit-cum-Means Scholarships in 2013 for supporting two economically backward students of Classes IX and X every year in his alma-mater, Ariadaha Kalachand High School, Kolkata 700057, India. This facilitates them to complete their secondary school education. ii) A Gold Medal Award at Ramakrishna Mission Vivekanda Centenary College, Rahara, Kolkata 700118, India in 2024 for the Best Graduating BSc(Hons) Student across all science disciplines (currently seven) to nurture bright science-minds for higher studies. iii) A Gold Medal Award at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata 700108 in 2003 for the Best M.Tech.(Computer Science) Dissertation to encourage and promote research excellence. iv) Besides, he has been donating frequently to the Student Assistant Fund of Imperial College of Science & Technology, London, UK, his another Alma-mater, to help students who face hardship to complete their study\n Patriotism: NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, USA, desired to offer him a \"Green card\" in 1991 requesting to stay permanently in the USA when he was working there as a National Research Council (US National Academy of Sciences) Guest Investigator (Resident Research Associate). But he turned down the offer and returned back to India to serve his country for ever.\n Family: Sunity Kumar Pal (father), Parul Bala Pal (mother), Amita (wife), Dhiman & Anshuman (sons). He is the second child of his parents with brother: Samir, and sisters: Anuradha, Anurupa and Sutapa. He came from a very ordinary family with a low-income group and many members. He thereforte knows the kind of hurdles and hardship one has to face to complete the higher studies and reach the position where he is today.\n Message: It is not only the height at which you are flying is important, but  from which lower height you had taken off should also be of equal (if not more) concern.",

        "Education": "As an undergraduate at MIT Perlman learned programming for a physics class. She was given her first paid job in 1971 as part-time programmer for the LOGO Lab at the (then) MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, programming system software such as debuggers. [14]\n Working under the supervision of Seymour Papert, she developed a child-friendly version of the educational robotics language LOGO, called TORTIS (\"Toddler's Own Recursive Turtle Interpreter System\"). During research performed in 1974–76, young children—the youngest aged 3½ years, programmed a LOGO educational robot called a Turtle. Perlman has been described as a pioneer of teaching young children computer programming.[15] Afterwards, she was inspired to make a new programming language that would teach much younger children similar to Logo, but using special \"keyboards\" and input devices. This project was abandoned because \"being the only woman around, I wanted to be taken seriously as a 'scientist' and was a little embarrassed that my project involved cute little kids\". MIT media project later tracked her down and told her that she started a new field called tangible user interface from the leftovers of her abandoned project. [16] As a math grad at MIT she needed to find an adviser for her thesis, and joined the MIT group at BBN Technologies. There she first got involved with designing network protocols.[17] Perlman obtained a B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in 1988.[18]  Her doctoral thesis on routing in environments where malicious network failures are present serves as the basis for much of the work that now exists in this area. [2]\n When studying at MIT in the late 60s she was one among the 50 or so women students, in a class of about 1,000 students. To begin with MIT only had one women’s dorm, limiting the number of women students that could study. When the men’s dorms at MIT became coed Perlman moved out of the women’s dorm into a mixed dorm, where she became the \"resident female\". She later said that she was so used to the gender imbalance, that it became normal. Only when she saw other women students among a crowd of men she noticed that \"it kind of looked weird\".[19]",

In this paper, he also introduced TF-IDF, or term-frequency-inverse-document frequency, a model in which the score of a term in a document is the ratio of the number of terms in that document divided by the frequency of the number of documents in which that term occurs. (The concept of inverse document frequency, a measure of specificity, had been introduced in 1972 by Karen Sparck-Jones.[4]) Later in life, he became interested in automatic text summarization and analysis,[5] as well as automatic hypertext generation.[6]  He published over 150 research articles and 5 books during his life.",

Simon's father, Arthur Simon (1881–1948), was a Jewish[13] electrical engineer who came to the United States from Germany in 1903 after earning his engineering degree at Technische Hochschule Darmstadt.[14] An inventor, Arthur also was an independent patent attorney.[15] Simon's mother, Edna Marguerite Merkel (1888–1969), was an accomplished pianist whose Jewish, Lutheran, and Catholic ancestors came from Braunschweig, Prague and Cologne.[16] Simon's European ancestors were piano makers, goldsmiths, and vintners.\n Simon attended Milwaukee Public Schools, where he developed an interest in science and established himself as an atheist. While attending middle school, Simon wrote a letter to \"the editor of the Milwaukee Journal defending the civil liberties of atheists\".[17] Unlike most children, Simon's family introduced him to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically; his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel (1892–1922), who studied economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison under John R. Commons, became one of his earliest influences. Through Harold's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered social science. Among his earliest influences, Simon cited Norman Angell for his book The Great Illusion and Henry George for his book Progress and Poverty. While attending high school, Simon joined the debate team, where he argued \"from conviction, rather than cussedness\" in favor of George's single tax.[18]\n In 1933, Simon entered the University of Chicago, and, following his early influences, decided to study social science and mathematics. Simon was interested in studying biology but chose not to pursue the field because of his \"color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory\".[19] At an early age, Simon learned he was color blind and discovered the external world is not the same as the perceived world. While in college, Simon focused on political science and economics. Simon's most important mentor was Henry Schultz, an econometrician and mathematical economist.[1] Simon received both his B.A. (1936) and his Ph.D. (1943) in political science from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Harold Lasswell, Nicolas Rashevsky, Rudolf Carnap, Henry Schultz, and Charles Edward Merriam.[20] After enrolling in a course on \"Measuring Municipal Governments,\" Simon became a research assistant for Clarence Ridley, and the two co-authored Measuring Municipal Activities: A Survey of Suggested Criteria for Appraising Administration in 1938.[21] Simon's studies led him to the field of organizational decision-making, which became the subject of his doctoral dissertation.",

At 13, Christopher went to Gresham's School, Holt where he showed signs of brilliance but in general performed poorly. He was admitted to King's College, Cambridge (the same college as Alan Turing) in 1935 where he continued to neglect his studies. Strachey studied mathematics and then transferred to physics. At the end of his third year at Cambridge, Strachey suffered a nervous breakdown, possibly related to coming to terms with his homosexuality.

Sketchpad was an innovative program that influenced alternative forms of interaction with computers. Sketchpad could accept constraints and specified relationships among segments and arcs, including the diameter of arcs. It could draw both horizontal and vertical lines and combine them into figures and shapes. Figures could be copied, moved, rotated, or resized, retaining their basic properties. Sketchpad also had the first window-drawing program and clipping algorithm, which allowed zooming. Sketchpad ran on the Lincoln TX-2 computer and influenced Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System.

To do this, he designed an articulated system that allowed the speaker to move a point or points next to the projection plate, at will, which made it possible to mark the areas of interest on the transparency.[121] The Didactic Projector improved the way slides were placed on glass plates for projection.[122]",

In making the program Winograd was concerned with the problem of providing a computer with sufficient \"understanding\" to be able to use natural language. Winograd built a blocks world, restricting the program's intellectual world to a simulated \"world of toy blocks\". The program could accept commands such as, \"Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box\" and carry out the requested action using a simulated block-moving  arm. The program could also respond verbally, for example, \"I do not know which block you mean.\" The SHRDLU program can be viewed historically as one of the classic examples of how difficult it is for a programmer to build up a computer's semantic memory by hand and how limited or \"brittle\" such programs are.[4]",

        "Awards": 17,
        "Education": "Zadeh became the Chair of Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1963. One of the lasting impacts of his leadership in this role is the expansion and the integration of computer science. He initiated and completed (in 1968) the transformation of the Electrical Engineering department at UC Berkeley to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). This strategic move not only led UC Berkeley's advancement into the top ranks of computer science education and research, but also led other research universities globally to add computer science to their electrical engineering departments. \nIn 1973, Lotfi Zadeh received the prestigious (Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers) IEEE Education Award, largely in recognition of his performance as chair of EE and then EECS. Other important services to UC Berkeley include his Academic Senate committee memberships: Academic Planning & Resource Allocation (1992–95); Committees (1969–70; 1980–81); Courses of Instruction (1975–80); and Faculty Awards (1990–92). Professor Zadeh graduated more than 50 PhD students, many of whom went on to become leaders in various areas of engineering, management and information sciences.[30]",
